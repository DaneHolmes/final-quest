# Final Quest
A minimal take on a text-based rpg. A very simple ruby exploration game that runs in your terminal. It lets you move through a matrix and read the description of each cell in the array, like you are moving through a 5 by 5 world.

# Installation
1. Open terminal
2. Check if the colorize gem is installed by running the command `gem list 'colorize' -i`. If true skip to step four. If false continue to step three.
3. If not installed on your computer run the command `gem install colorize`
4. Run the command `ruby THE/PATH/TO/FinalQuest/fq.rb`
5. The easiest way to do this is to type ruby and a space, then drag the fq.rb file from finder into terminal.
